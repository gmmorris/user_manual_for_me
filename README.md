# User Manual For Gidi Morris

A User Manual for working with me.

## Conditions I like to work in

I work most effectively when I have some form of white noise.
Buzzing well-lit offices or coffee shops suit me well, while quiet dark rooms actually make it harder for me to slip into deep work.

For this reason I usually work from the Elastic London office.

## The times/hours I like to work

I'm a morning person and aim to be begin working some time between 7:00 and 7:30, whether from home or from my preferred location outside of home.

I'm often active in the evenings, so usually call it a day by 17:00-18:00.

## The best ways to communicate with me

_Slack_ is the quickest way to get a response from me.
Please don't hesitate to reach out at any time, as I'll put the phone on silent if I'm busy, and am always happy to help a colleague out of hours. I find the idea of you being blocked on something that I could be helping with more disturbing than the idea of being asked for thing out of hours.

I don't like answering my phone, as I'm often in spaces which are either too noisy for that or so quiet that my conversation would be _forced_ on those around me.
I do read texts though, so SMS or WhatsApp are cool.

I stay on top of my emails daily, so for anything non-urgent, feel confident that your email will get a reply within a workday or so.

## The ways I like to receive feedback

Be direct.
I am much more comfortable with candor and difficult conversations, than with things being left unspoken, so please just be straight with me.

I consider all feedback a learning opportunity, and do my very best not to get defensive.
You can [read my blog](https://gidi.io/2018/08/04/feedback-and-cake.html) to learn about my ideas on effective feedback and that should help you figure out how best to talk with me about such things.

Face to face is ideal, in lieu of that a Zoom call and if that's hard, then a phone call.

I have a hard time taking feedback in asynchronous form, such as emails or instant messaging, so please, focus in synchronous forms of communication.

## Things I need

Clarity and over communication.
I have a hard time following through on tasks when I don't understand _why_ we're doing them, and so I crave involvement in as many conversations as possible and as much background information as possible before delving into a task.

This is predominantly because I like to know that I'm solving the _right_ problem, rather than a perceived one or a symptom.

## Things I struggle with

I'm an introvert, and need time to recharge between conversations, but I'm also a social creature, and find it hard to go through full days without having some kind of collaborative interaction with colleagues.

If I don't understand the wider purpose behind why we are doing something, I find it hard to engage with it.

I dislike Gatekeeping, and will always prefer to incur some discomfort by letting it through the gate, whenever it is something that can be addressed at a later point. This is true for hiring (They seem like a positive fit but lack something that we need? Lets bring them in and empower them to fill the gaps) and is equally true for the ways in which we work (How often have you heard the phrase "That's how we've always done it"? Lets try new ideas and iterate on them instead of just saying "No!").

Organising team social things. I really struggle at this, please don't ask me to organise anything like that.

## Things I love

I love collaborating on things, be it brain storming sessions, pair programming or random conversations about things.

I like hearing about other people's challenges, it helps me get comfortable with my own, and gives me opportunities to share my own experience and ideas.

I love teaching, mentor individuals outside of the workplace, and am always open to taking on new mentees (time permitted).

## Other things to know about me

I bring my whole self to work, always, and am extremely uncomfortable when I can't do so.
